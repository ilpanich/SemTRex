# SemTRex

This repo contains my Ph. D. thesis work which is an extension to an existing CEP engine, called TRex and developed at Politecnico di Milano by Alessandro Margara, Gianpaolo Cugola and others.
The original and up-to-date version of the engine is available [here](https://github.com/deib-polimi/TRex).

The extension aims to allow the engine to query a RDF static repo to retrieve data from it, and it has been developed based on one of the first version of the system, before it was moved on Github (so the code base is very different).

The system also provide a basic cache implementation.

In my mind (and also in my Ph. D. thesis, freely available [here](https://www.politesi.polimi.it/handle/10589/98542) I have outlined several enhancements of the system and of the cache, still lacking of the implementation due to time constraints.
